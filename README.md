# Cursed Fund

Cursed Fund is a social experiment within Galleon & Cursed DAO enabling members to vote on ETH  market sentiment that ultimately creates a weekly portfolio allocation for a wallet holding 10,000 USDC . Over time, a positive ROI creates a % based liquidity provisioning of DBL/WETH through a small monthly rake.
